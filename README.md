AI-Powered Lab Test Recommender (Streamlit App)
# ðŸ§ª AI-Powered Lab Test Recommender

An interactive Streamlit-based machine learning application that recommends suitable diagnostic lab tests based on patient age, gender, and symptoms.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project aims to demonstrate a clinical decision-support system using machine learning. The model predicts which lab test (e.g., CBC, MRI, X-Ray) is most appropriate based on user inputs. Itâ€™s ideal for learning AI implementation in healthcare and showcasing ML app deployment with Streamlit.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Accepts patient inputs: Age, Gender, and Symptom
- Uses a trained Random Forest Classifier for prediction
- Instant lab test recommendation with one click
- Clean and responsive Streamlit user interface
- Fully compatible with deployment on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib
